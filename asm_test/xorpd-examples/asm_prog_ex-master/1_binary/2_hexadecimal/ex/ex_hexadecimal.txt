Base 16 exercises
------------------

Hello! Some Base 16 related exercises are included here. As usual, the first
exercises are a bit easy (And might be boring), however it is very important
that you do those if you want to do the next ones, and especially if you want to
understand the rest of the course. We are going to use base 16 everywhere in
this course.

To make sure that you understand things right, Use a calculator from time to
time to check your answers. The Windows calculator (When in Programmer mode) has
the feature of changing the base of the current number. It has the built in
options of Hex, Dec, Oct(Octal - base 8) and Bin. Use those to check your
answers.

Although you could use a calculator or a computer to solve the simpler
exercises, make sure that you do them with a pen and a paper.


0.  Convert the following numbers to binary:

  0.0   0xD = {?}_2
  
  0.1   0xF = {?}_2

  0.2   0x3A = {?}_2

  0.3   0x4532 = {?}_2

  0.4   0x9A9B = {?}_?


1. Convert the following binary numbers to base 16:
  
  1.0   {10}_2 = {?}_16

  1.1   {110}_2 = {?}_16

  1.2   {1011}_2 = {?}_16

  1.3   {11110101}_2 = {?}_16

  1.4   {1111100}_2 = {?}_16

  1.5   {1010101111001101}_2 = {?}_16


2. Convert the following numbers (Pay attention to the wanted result base):

  2.0   {10110}_2 = {?}_8

  2.1   {1100111}_2 = {?}_8

  2.2   {101001}_2 = {?}_4

  2.3   {3725}_8 = {?}_2

  2.4   {57137}_8 = {?}_4   (Hint: Try to use base 2 as a mediator.)


3.  Think of an easy way to convert numbers from base 16 to base 4, and vice
    versa.


4.  Basic divisibility rules:

  4.0   How could you check if a number represented in base 16 is divisible by
        2?

  4.1   Bonus: How could you check if a number represented in base 16 is
        divisible by 4? By 8?


*5*.Bonus: How could you check if a number represented in base 16 is divisible
    by 3? And by 15? Could you think of another interesting divisibility rule?


6.  Bonus: It is known that a number x has n digits when it is represented in
    base 4. How many digits will x have when it is represented in base 8?


7.  Bonus: 
    Required: Basic familiarity with the notion of complexity.

    What is the computational complexity of the new hex to binary
    conversion algorithm we learned about in this lesson? Is it faster than
    using the Remainder Evaluation method?


Happy thinking :)
