Signed Numbers
--------------
Welcome to the exercises page for signed numbers!

Some ten's complement and two's complement exercises are included. The first
exercises are a bit easier, though it is very important that you do those with a
pen and paper, just to make sure that you understand everything.

The next exercises are not mandatory, and could deepen your understanding about
signed numbers. I recommend to take a look at them.

Make sure to check yourself from time to time using a calculator. The windows
calculator for example has the feature of representing signed numbers. Try to
eliminate the usage of a calculator to the minimum using the actual solving of
the questions. I recommend that you don't use it at all.


The ten's complement
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

0.  Find the ten's complement of the following numbers:
    (Note: All numbers here are in base 10)

  0.0   18  (When living in the world of 2 decimal digits).

  0.1   25  (When living in the world of 3 decimal digits).

  0.2   131 (When living in the world of 3 decimal digits).


1.  Solve the following using the ten's complement method:
    (Note: We are working in base 10 here.)
    Hint: Change the subtrahend to its ten's complement form.
          Make sure to fix the amount of decimal digits being used.

  1.0   35 - 6 = ?

  1.1   111 - 17 = ?

  1.2   425 - 296 = ?

  1.3   6312 - 4129 = ?


The two's complement
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

2.  Find the two's complement of the following binary numbers:
    (Note: All numbers here are in base 2):

  2.0   {1001}_2  (In the world of 4 bits).

  2.1   {1110}_2  (In the world of 5 bits).

  2.2   {1}_2     (In the world of 8 bits).

  2.3   {11001100}_2  (In the world of 8 bits).


3.  Solve the following using the two's complement method:
    Hint: Change the subtrahend to its two's complement form.
          Make sure to fix the amount of bits used.
  
  3.0   {1101}_2 - {1001}_2 = ?

  3.1   {1010111}_2 - {100110}_2 = ?

  3.2   {10111}_2 - {1100}_2 = ?

4.  Find the signed form (two's complement) of the following decimal numbers:
    Fix the number of bits to be 8.

  4.0   125

  4.1   -15

  4.2   5

  4.3   127

  4.4   -65


5.  Transform the following decimal exercises into the binary two's complement
    form, solve it using the binary form, and convert it back to
    decimal.
    Finally, Check if the result is correct.

  5.0   68 - 19 = ?

  5.1   120 - 63 = ?

  5.2   45 - 29 = ?


6.  Bonus: Consider the world of 8 bits (Byte) with the two's complement
    interpretation. Every number has it's negative corresponding number. We have
    seen that 0 is it's own complement, and also {10000000}_2 is it's own
    complement.

  6.0   Which decimal number is represented by {10000000}_2 ?

  6.1   Are there any more numbers which are their own negation? Prove your
        answer.


7.  Bonus: The amount of binary numbers.
  
  7.0   How many binary numbers with 8 bits exist?

  7.1   Considering the two's complement interpretation, how many binary numbers
        with 8 digits are positive? Negative? 
        Recall that we define the positive
        numbers to be the numbers that has "0" as their 8th bit.

  7.2   Which is more? Positive numbers or Negative numbers? Why?

  7.3   Answer the same questions for the set of binary numbers with n bits.


8.  Bonus: Division by 2: 

  8.0   Assume the unsigned interpretation of binary numbers.
    
    8.0.0   How much is {10010}_2 divided by 2?

    8.0.1   How much is {100}_2 divided by 2?

    8.0.2   Could you find a general way of dividing by 2?

  8.1   Assume the signed interpretation of binary numbers. (two's complement).
        Fix the number of bits to be 8, for example.

    8.1.0   How much is {00010010}_2 divided by 2? 

    8.1.1   How much is {11001000}_2 divided by 2?

    8.1.2   How much is {10110110}_2 divided by 2?

    8.1.3   Find a general way of dividing by 2 in the two's complement
            interpretation.

9.  Relation to base 16:

  We can recognize that a binary number in the two's complemenet
  interpretation is negative by looking at the most siginificant bit (Bit
  number 8 if we live in the world of 8 bits).

  How could it be done for the equivalent number in base 16?
  Find out whether the following numbers are positive or negative, in the two's
  complement interpretation in the world of 8 bits:

  9.0   0x3
    Example for solution: 0x3 = {0000 0011}_2. This number is positive because
    the most significant bit (Number 8) is 0.
  
  9.1   0x35

  9.2   0xAB

  9.3   0x77

  9.4   0x7F

  9.5   0x80


Happy thinking :)
