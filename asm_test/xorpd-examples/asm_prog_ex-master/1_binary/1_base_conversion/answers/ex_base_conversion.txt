Base conversion exercises
--------------------------

0.  Binary to Decimal conversion. Convert the following numbers to base 10:

    You may use a calculator if you feel like it, however please don't use the
    built in conversion function. 

    It is important that you do this yourself, to make sure that you get the
    feeling of it. Some things could only be learned through the hands.

  
  0.0   {10}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:
     
    {10}_2 = 2^0 * 0 + 2^1 * 1 = 2


  0.1   {100}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {100}_2 = 2^0 * 0 + 2^1 * 0 + 2^2 * 1 = 4

  0.2   {101}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {101}_2 = 2^0 * 1 + 2^1 * 0 + 2^2 * 1 = 5

  0.3   {1001110}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {1001110}_2 = 2^0 * 0 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^2 * 1 + 2^3 * 1 + 2^4 * 0 + 2^5 * 0 + 2^6 * 1 
                = 0 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 64 
                = 78

  0.4   {100110011}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {100110011}_2 = 2^0 * 1 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^2 * 0 + 2^3 * 0 + 2^4 * 1 + 2^5 * 1 + 2^6 * 0 + 2^7 * 0 + 2^8 * 1 
                  = 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 256 
                  = 307


  0.5   {111111}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {111111}_2 = 2^0 * 1 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^2 * 1 + 2^3 * 1 + 2^4 * 1 + 2^5 * 1 
               = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32
               = 63

  0.6   {1000}_2 = ?

    ANSWER:

    {1000}_2 = 2^0 * 0 + 2^1 * 0 + 2^2 * 0 + 2^3 * 1
             = 0 + 0 + 0 + 8
             = 8

  0.7   {10000}_2 = ? (Bonus: Could you guess this one? How?)

    ANSWER:

    Compared to the previous answer, this one is multiplied by 2. When multiplying a binary number by 2,
    you simply shift all numbers to left and add a 0 to the right. So 8 * 2 = 16

    {10000}_2 = 2^0 * 0 + 2^1 * 0 + 2^2 * 0 + 2^3 * 0 + 2^4 * 1 
              = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16
              = 16

  1.6   {256}_10 = ? (Bonus: Could you guess this one? How?)

    ANSWER:

    This would be answer 1.4 multiplied by 2. Multiplication by 2 means a bitshift to the right,
    so probably the answer is 100000000.

    256 | 0
    128 | 0
     64 | 0
     32 | 0
     16 | 0
      8 | 0
      4 | 0
      2 | 0
      1 | 1

    {256}_10 = {100000000}_2


2.  Conversion between various bases and 10:

    Make sure that you pick a smart method to do the conversion in the following
    exercises :)

  2.0   {2312}_5 = {?}_10 ?

    ANSWER:

    {2312}_5 = 2 * 5^0 + 1 * 5^1 + 3 * 5^2 + 2 * 5^3
             = 2 + 5 + 75 + 250
             = 332

  2.1   {10120}_3 = {?}_10 ?

    ANSWER:

    {10120}_3 = 0 * 3^0 + 2 * 3^1 + 1 * 3^2 + 0 * 3^3 + 1 * 3^4
              = 0 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 81
              = 96

  2.2   {121}_10 = {?}_3 ?

    ANSWER:

    121 | 1
     40 | 1
     13 | 1
      4 | 1
      1 | 1

    {121}_10 = {11111}_3

  2.3   {121}_10 = {?}_6 ?

    121 | 1
     20 | 2
      3 | 3

    {121}_10 = {321}_6


3. Conversion between two arbitrary bases.
  
    Convert the following numbers' representations.

    Hint: Given that you know how to convert to base 10 and from base 10 easily,
    you could just use base 10 as a mediator base.

    Example: {102}_3 = {?}_5 ?

    Solution:
    First we convert from base 3 to base 10. 
    We use Direct Evaluation method:

    {102}_3 = 2*3^0 + 0*3^1 + 1*3^2 = 2 + 0 + 9 = {11}_10

    Now we want to convert the result from base 10 to base 5. We use the
    Remainder Evaluation method:

    11 |  1    11 % 5 = 1
     2 |  2     2 % 5 = 2

    We obtain the number {21}_5. Hence {102}_3 = {21}_5

  3.0   {10010}_2 = {?}_5 ?

    ANSWER:

    {10010}_2 = 0 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4
              = 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 16
              = 18

    18 | 3
     3 | 3

    {10010}_2 = {33}_5


  3.1   {102}_3 = {?}_2 ?

    ANSWER: 

    {102}_3 = 2 * 3^0 + 0 * 3^1 + 1 * 3^2 
            = 2 + 0 + 9
            = 11

    11 | 1
     5 | 1
     2 | 0
     1 | 1

    {102}_3 = {1011}_2

  3.2   {11011}_2 = {?}_3 ?

    ANSWER:

    {11011}_2 = 1 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4
              = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 16
              = 27

    27 | 0
     9 | 0
     3 | 0
     1 | 1

    {11011}_2 = {1000}_3

  3.3   {1402}_5 = {?}_2 ?

    ANSWER:

    {1402}_5  = 2 * 5^0 + 0 * 5^1 + 4 * 5^2 + 1 * 5^3
              = 2 + 0 + 100 + 125
              = 227

    227 | 1
    113 | 1
     56 | 0
     28 | 0
     14 | 0
      7 | 1
      3 | 1
      1 | 1

    {1402}_5 = {11100011}_2
