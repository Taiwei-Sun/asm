CALL and RET exercises ideas

Intro
-----
- local labels.
- Checking that the stack is balanced.

Read code
---------

- (Fair and Square) Function for printing a rectangle (Made of stars).
  - Will contain a function for a line.
  -- done.

- (Catapult) Playground: Using ret to jump.
  -- done.
  

- (Vec sum) Function for adding vectors?
  -- done.

- Recursion (Bonus?)
  - Increasing one number.
    -- done. (rec adder).
  - Fibonacci. (Bonus).


Write code
----------

- Random picture: Write a function that takes an integer in eax, and prints to
  the screen stars according to the bit representation of eax.
  Every two bits will become a symbol, so we will have a picture of 4X4.

  Function for getting the symbol.

  Function for taking the number and filling in some buffer.

  print the picture.

  -- done. (Dword picture.)


- Write a function that checks if a number is prime.
  Calculate the amount of primes until the number n.
  How many primes are there from 1 to n?
  -- done (Prime counting)

- Nested: 
    - Write a function to calculate a^x.
    - Write a function to calculate the remainder of : (a^x - b^x)/(a-b)
    - Write a function that iterates over all the number a<=k,b<=m of size
      words, and find the maximum remainder.
    - Call this function with arguments 100h,100h


- Playground: Use call to find the value of eip.
  -- done (Find yourself)
