Base conversion exercises
--------------------------

Hey, some Base conversion exercises are included here. The first ones are pretty
usual, and could be dull at times, but please do them if this is your first time
with base 2. Also, make sure that you do them with a pen and a piece of paper. I
can't emphasize it more, you got to get the feeling through the hands, at least
on the first time.

As you move on with the exercises there are some that require more thinking.
As usual, anything marked with *Bonus* is not required for you to understand the
following material, however it will probably make you smarter.


0.  Binary to Decimal conversion. Convert the following numbers to base 10:

    You may use a calculator if you feel like it, however please don't use the
    built in conversion function. 

    It is important that you do this yourself, to make sure that you get the
    feeling of it. Some things could only be learned through the hands.

  
  0.0   {10}_2 = ?

  0.1   {100}_2 = ?

  0.2   {101}_2 = ?

  0.3   {1001110}_2 = ?

  0.4   {100110011}_2 = ?

  0.5   {111111}_2 = ?

  0.6   {1000}_2 = ?

  0.7   {10000}_2 = ? (Bonus: Could you guess this one? How?)


1.  Decimal to Binary conversion. Convert the following numbers to base 2:

  1.0   {2}_10 = ?

  1.1   {5}_10 = ?

  1.2   {83}_10 = ?

  1.3   {134}_10 = ?

  1.4   {128}_10 = ?

  1.5   {63}_10 = ?

  1.6   {256}_10 = ? (Bonus: Could you guess this one? How?)


2.  Conversion between various bases and 10:

    Make sure that you pick a smart method to do the conversion in the following
    exercises :)

  2.0   {2312}_5 = {?}_10 ?

  2.1   {10120}_3 = {?}_10 ?

  2.2   {121}_10 = {?}_3 ?

  2.3   {121}_10 = {?}_6 ?


3. Conversion between two arbitrary bases.
  
    Convert the following numbers' representations.

    Hint: Given that you know how to convert to base 10 and from base 10 easily,
    you could just use base 10 as a mediator base.

    Example: {102}_3 = {?}_5 ?

    Solution:
    First we convert from base 3 to base 10. 
    We use Direct Evaluation method:

    {102}_3 = 2*3^0 + 0*3^1 + 1*3^2 = 2 + 0 + 9 = {11}_10

    Now we want to convert the result from base 10 to base 5. We use the
    Remainder Evaluation method:

    11 |  1    11 % 5 = 1
     2 |  2     2 % 5 = 2

    We obtain the number {21}_5. Hence {102}_3 = {21}_5

  3.0   {10010}_2 = {?}_5 ?

  3.1   {102}_3 = {?}_2 ?

  3.2   {11011}_2 = {?}_3 ?

  3.3   {1402}_5 = {?}_2 ?


4.  Bonus: For the mathematically inclined:
    (I still recommend you to at least read this. You might find it
    interesting.)

  4.0 Existence of representation: 

      During the presentation we implicitly assumed that there is a
      representation in base 2 for every number that could be represented in
      base 10. How could you prove it?

      Generally, how could you prove that using base b for some b > 1, every
      integral quantity could be represented in base b?

  4.1 Uniqueness of representation:

      During the representation we mentioned that every quantity could be
      represented in a unique way in base 2. That means: Every quantity could be
      represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 in a unique way. prove it.

      Generally: Let b be some base for b > 1. Show that for any quantity
      q, there is only one way to represent q in base b.

      Hint for b=2:
      Assume that there are two different representations as sums of distinct
      powers of 2 for the same quantity q. Then we get:
      2^(a_0) + 2^(a_1) + ... = q = 2^(b_0) + 2^(b_1) + ...
      Cancel the similar terms from the two sides of the equation, and try to
      understand if equality is possible.


5. Bonus: Symmetry of bases:

  5.0 We now know that there is nothing special about base 10. Why then do we
      use it as a mediator in Question 3, instead of converting directly between
      two arbitrary bases?

  5.1 Once in a lifetime experience: Try to convert the number
      {1241}_5 into base 3 directly, without using base 10 as a mediator. (Use
      your mind, a pen and a paper).


6. Bonus: Divisibility by interesting numbers.

  6.0 How could you check if a binary represented number is divisible by 2?
      And By 4? Could you generalize it?

  *6.1* How could you check if a binary represented number is divisible by 3?


7. Bonus: Complexity of conversion algorithms.
   Required: Basic understanding of what is complexity.

   It might be interesting to find out how fast do the base conversion
   algorithms work. 

   For example: looking at the execution of the Direct Evaluation method while
   converting a number n from base b to base c: The algorithm iterates over all
   the digits of the number n, and invokes one addition operation and one
   exponentiation for every digit. A total of about O(log{b}(n)) operations.

   In this context we choose basic operations to be addition, subtraction,
   division and exponentiation.
   
  7.0 What is the amount of basic operations it takes to run the "Finding
      largest power" method?
  
  7.1 What is the amount of basic operations it takes to run the "Remainder
      evaluation" method?


Happy thinking :)
